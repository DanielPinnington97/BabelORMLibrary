##About BabelORM

Babel has been designed to be a near zero user configuration object relational mapping library. What this means is that upon successful installation a user will be able to persist POJO's into their choice of RDBS (provided it is in the dependancy file). Using the set up instructions it is possible to achieve minimum interation with the library to persist a java object.To use Babel all you need to do is add the library to your dependency file e.g. pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle).
